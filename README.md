## *Snake* in the terminal

*Snake* is a popular game, in which you control a snake. You must eat the fruits, and the snake will grow.
You will lose if you go off the screen or if you try to eat your own body :).

I recreated this game in the **C language**. It runs on **the terminal** (Linux only, because of some libraries).
Because it is C, you must compile it yourself if you want to play.

Since my last game recreation(flappy bird), I got better (better variable names, so much easier to read code, I split it into functions).

Thanks for reading this!!
